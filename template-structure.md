## 2. Executive Summary

2-3 paragraphs, plain language. Cover:
1. What this proposal delivers (conversational, not corporate)
2. Why this approach beats alternatives
3. Keep it direct — "This proposal does X. Here's why it matters."

**If bundling multiple systems**, add a "Why Combined Is Better" subsection:
- One Data Model: enter once, use everywhere
- One Dashboard: see everything in one place
- Gets More Valuable Over Time: each engagement adds data
- Cheaper Together: shared infrastructure
- One Vendor, One Retainer: one relationship, one bill

Group by system/phase if multiple. Each system gets a labeled subsection:
- "System 1: Custom CRM (Notion + n8n)"

- etc.

Column widths: 35% / 65% of content area.

**The Result:** 1-2 sentences with specific metrics. Hours saved, percentage improvements, capability unlocked.

## 11. Why Veteran Vectors

3-5 short, punchy differentiators. Each has a **bold label** followed by 2-3 sentences.

### Standard Differentiators (customize per client)

**Veteran to Veteran:** Military background, understanding of military-adjacent businesses and what it takes to build systems that don't break when it matters.

**Built for Small Teams:** We work with 2-20 person companies. Every system is custom-built for exactly what you need. Nothing extra.

**You Own Everything:** Notion and n8n are your accounts. If we part ways, you keep it all. No vendor lock-in.

**Defense Industry Experience:** (include only if relevant) Active engagements with defense consulting firms building classified-ready platforms. Understand NDAs, security requirements, and sensitivity.

**Process First, Tools Second:** We define the process, then automate it. That's why the automation sticks.

Drop irrelevant ones, add client-specific ones as needed.
